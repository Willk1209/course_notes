# 001.Introduction and overview

## Introduction of the requirement:

**Homework1:** Multi-task data processing, black-box meta-learning

**Homework2:** Gradient-based meta-learning & metric learning

**Homework3:** Multi-task RL, goal relabeling

**Final project:** Research-level project of my choice

## Overview:

How can we <u>enable **agents** to learn skills</u> in the real world?

**Specialist - > Generalist**

**Why deep learning?**

It allows us to handle unstructured inputs.(pixels, language, sensor readings, etc.)

###  What is a task?

Taking some **data** and the **loss function** as input, and get a model **f_theta.**

### Critical Assumption

- **The bad news**: Different tasks <u>**need to share some structure**</u>.                                                     (If this doesnâ€™t hold, you are bejer off using single-task learning.)
- **The good news**: There are many tasks with shared structure!

### Informal Problem Definitions

- **The multi-task learning problem**: Learn all of the tasks more quickly or more proficiently than learning them independently.
- **The meta-learning problem**: Given data on previous tasks, learn a new task more quickly and/or more proficiently.
