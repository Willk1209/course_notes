# 17.正交矩阵和Gram-Schmidt正交化

1. Orthogonal basis.

2. Orthonormal vectors and orthonormal matrices(must be a square):
   $$
   q_i^Tq_j = 
   \cases{0\quad j\neq j\\
   1\quad i=j}
   $$

   1. Means every q is orthogonal to other q.
   2. For orthonormal matrix <u>Q=[q;q2…qn]</u>, we have <u>**Q^TQ=I**</u> and <u>**Q^T=Q^{−1}**</u>.

3. **The dot product** of <u>a vector and a orthonormal basis</u>, equal to its projection on that basis.
   $$
   \hat x_i = q^T_ib
   $$

### Gram-Schmidt:

- Procedure:

  - Begin by choosing A = a. The next direction B must be perpendicular to A.

  - First Gram-Schmidt step:
    $$
    B=b-\frac{A^Tb}{A^TA}A
    $$
    

  - Next Gram-Schmidt step:
    $$
    C=c-\frac{A^Tc}{A^TA}A-\frac{B^Tc}{B^TB}B
    $$

  - A, B, C should divided by ||A||, ||B||, ||C||, and finally we get q_1, q_2, and q_3.

- Graham-Schmidt calculation and elimination: **A=QR**, where Q is the orthonormal matrix, R is upper trianglar matrix.
