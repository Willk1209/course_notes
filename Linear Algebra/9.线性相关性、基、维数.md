## Independence

* Vectors x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are indenpendent if **no combination gives zero vector**(except the zero comb., all c_i=0). i.e. :
  $$
  c_1x_1+c_2x_2+...+c_nx_n \neq 0
  $$

* **Repeat** when v_1, ..., v_n are columns of A:
  * They are independent if <u>nullspace of A is **only {zero vector}**</u>. no free var..
    * In this case, **the rank is n**
  * They are dependent if Ac = 0 for **<u>some nonzero c</u>**. exists free var..
    * In this case, **the rank is smaller than n**

### Span a space

Vectors v_1, ..., v_n **span a space means**: The space consists of all combinations of these vectors.

## Basics

* Basics for a space is a sequence of vectors v_1, v_2, ... , v_d, with two properties:
  * they are independent.
  * they span a space.
* R^n n vectors give basic if the n*n matrix is invertible. 



* **Given a space:** Every basic for the space has the same number of vectors. And then we get <u>Def DIMENSION OF THE SPACE</u>

## Dimension

- **rank(A) = #pivot columns = dimension of C(A)**
- **N(A)** can tell us <u>what way the cols are dependent</u>.

* **dim(N(A)) =  n-r**, special solution of null space can form a basic for the null space.
