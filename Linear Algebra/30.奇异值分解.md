1. SVD: singular value decomposition. A is a matrix that 
   $$
   A\in R^{m\times n}
   $$
   singular value decomposition means the linear transformation from an orthonormal basis in row space 
   $$
   V=\left[
   \matrix{
   v_1&v_2&...&v_m
   }
   \right]
   $$
   of A into an orthonormal basis in column space
   $$
   U=\left[
   \matrix{
   u_1&u_2&...&u_n
   }
   \right]
   $$
   of A. Of course, U and V are both invertible.

2. We have 
   $$
   Av_i = \sigma_i u_i
   $$
   where sigma_i is the scalar factor, called singular value. Suppose m > n, sigma_i = 0, for all i that n < i <= m.

3. We have 
   $$
   AV=\Sigma U
   $$
   where Sigma is a diagonal matrix. Then
   $$
   A=U\Sigma V^{-1}=U\Sigma V^T
   $$
   thus
   $$
   A^TA=V\Sigma U^TU\Sigma V^T = V\Sigma^2V^T
   $$
   because A^TA is a symmetric positive definite matrix, and lambda_i is it's eigenvalues.
   $$
   \sigma_i = \sqrt \lambda_i
   $$
   Obviously, V^T is the eigenvector matrix of A^TA.

4. With the same approach we can get
   $$
   AA^T=U\Sigma^2U^T
   $$
