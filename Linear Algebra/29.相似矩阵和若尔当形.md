# 29.相似矩阵和若尔当形

1. Inverse of a symmetric positive matrix is also a positive definite matrix.

2. Least squares: 
   $$
   Ax=Y->A^TAx=A^TY
   $$
   when A^TA is positive definite, x will get the best solutions.

   For retangular matrix
   $$
   A\in R^{m\times n},m>n
   $$
   A^TA is symmetric matrix. When columns of A are independent, A^TA is positive definite:
   $$
   x^TA^TAx=(Ax)^T(Ax)=|Ax|^2\geq 0
   $$

3. **Similar matrices**: A and B are similar means for some invertible matrix M,
   $$
   B=M^{-1}AM
   $$
   Similar matrices have same eigenvalues.

4. A is diagonalizable:
   $$
   A=S^{-1}\Lambda S
   $$
   S is the eigenvector matrix of A.

5. Jordan matrix: every Jordan block has one repeated eigenvalue and one eigenvector.
