# 28.正定矩阵和最小值

1. **Positive definite matrix**: A is a symmetric matrix and
   $$
   \forall x, x^TAx>0
   $$
   determinants of leading submatrices are all positive.

2. If a n-dimensions function has minimum, it's first derivatives matrix <u>du/dx equals to zero</u> and second derivatives matrix <u>d2u/dx2 is positve definite</u>.
3. Principal axis theorem: A is symmetric and A=QΛQT, the eigenvalues (all positive) tell the lengths of the principal axes and the eigenvectors tell the directions of the principal axes.
