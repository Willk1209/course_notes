## Orthogonality


$$
x^Ty=0\\
|x|^2+|y|^2=|x+y|^2
$$

* Length of vectors:

$$
|x|^2=x^Tx
$$

* Subspace S is orthogonal to subspace <u>T</u>: every vector in <u>S</u> is orthogonal to every vector in <u>T</u>, <u>ST = 0</u>.
* **How to solve equations that can’t be solved**: 
  * solve <u>Ax=b</u>, but <u>b</u> is not in the column space of <u>A</u>, but the cloest problem (let <u>b</u> as the cloest vector in column space of <u>A</u>, in other words, the projection of <u>b</u> on <u>A</u>), the new equation <u>A^TAx=A^Tb</u> can be solved. 
* <u>A^TA</u> is invertible exactly if the nullspace <u>N(A)</u> only has the zero vector, in other words, <u>A</u> has independent columns.
