# 31.线性变换及对应矩阵

1. Linear transformation: every linear transformation leads to a matrix.

2. Mapping: x→T(x) where x is a vector.

3. The two rules of linear transformation:

   * T(v+w) = T(v) + T(w)
   * T(cv) = cT(v)

4. If the matrix A is the matrix of some linear transformation T, then T(x) = Ax.

5. Coordinates come from a basis, let 
   $$
   v=c_1v_1+c_2v_2+⋯+c_nv_n
   $$
   , then the coordinate of v on the basis
